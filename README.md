This is a program to download the Gemini Bitcoin minute data set and reduce it to 930am and 4pm EST 
each day to allow for easier comparison to financial assets that are traded on US exchanges. 

## Getting Started

The instructions to run the program are accompanying the code in the jupyter notebook file.
